To use this program just both lua files in a .ASC/notes folder in your home directory.
Use ~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua add      to take a note
Use ~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua readF    to read your notes
Use ~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua del n    to delete the n-th note you took


To use the program automaticaly, as I intended, there is more option
Use ~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua read     to read your notes once
Use ~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua reset    to be able to read your notes using the read option again

To use this progral I put 
~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua read 
in my .bashrc file and I crate cron jobs which use the comand
Use ~/.ASC/notes/interface.lua reset
every time I restart my computer and every 6 hours
